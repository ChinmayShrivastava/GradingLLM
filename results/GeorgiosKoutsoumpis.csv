"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint. Good effort in explaining the implementation of scrum/sprint, but the chosen function might not be the best fit. Keep up the good work!"
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. 

Your response provided a general overview of scrum/sprint methodologies but lacked specific details on how they could operate for the chosen Mighty Jaxx business function."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit. 

Comment: Good effort in discussing the implementation of kanban and scrum/sprint methodologies, but the explanation of why kanban is a poor fit for the chosen function could be clearer and more specific. Keep up the good work!"
10 pts - You clearly identified the Production function as the one that could benefit the most from implementing kanban methodologies and provided a list of possible columns for the kanban board. Great job!
12 pts - Very complete and clear description of how kanban could operate. Great job explaining the process and its benefits for the Production function.
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit. 

Your explanation of how scrum/sprint could benefit the ""Use 3D renderings and drawings as input to producing molds for manufacturing"" function is well thought out. However, the discussion on why scrum/sprint is a poor fit for production could be more specific and detailed. Keep up the good work!"
"5 pts - Selected bias is clearly relevant to this situation

Great job identifying the overconfidence bias and providing actionable steps to avoid it. Keep up the good work!"
"10/10

Great job defining the overconfidence bias and providing actionable suggestions to avoid it. Keep up the excellent work!"
"10/10 - Reasonable description, but missing some detail. Great effort in explaining the methodologies and their application to Mighty Jaxx's processes. Keep up the good work!"
"8/10 - Good job on providing a clear description of the scrum/sprint methodology and how it can be applied to the ""Use 3D renderings and drawings as input to producing molds for manufacturing"" function. However, the description could have been more detailed in terms of specific steps or actions. Keep up the good work!"
