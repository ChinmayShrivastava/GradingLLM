"8 pts - You identified the marketing function as a potential area to benefit from scrum/sprint methodologies, but the explanation could be more specific on how it would operate within that function."
"10 pts - Some vagueness in description, but largely OK. Good effort in explaining the scrum/sprint and kanban methodologies for marketing and delivery functions. Keep working on providing more specific details."

"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit. 

Your response provided a good explanation of how scrum/sprint could benefit the marketing function, but the discussion on why it is a poor fit for the delivery function was not as clear. Keep up the good work and try to provide more specific details in future responses."
