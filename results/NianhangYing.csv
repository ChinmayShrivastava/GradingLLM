"4 pts - Not really clear that this bias is relevant to the situation.

Comment: You mentioned overconfidence bias, but it's not clearly connected to the decision-making process about moving to agile. Try to provide a more specific example of how this bias could impact the decision and suggest steps to avoid it."

Your description of overconfidence bias is somewhat accurate, but it could be clearer and more concise. Make sure to focus on defining the bias itself rather than discussing its potential impact on Mighty Jaxx."
