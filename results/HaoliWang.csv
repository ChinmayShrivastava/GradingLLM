"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint. 

Comment: Good effort in identifying multiple business functions that could benefit from scrum/sprint methodologies, but the prompt asked for just one function. Focus on one function and provide a more detailed explanation of how scrum/sprint could operate for that function."
