"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint.

Comment: Good effort in identifying the Design and Marketing teams as potential beneficiaries of scrum/sprint methodologies. However, the explanation could be more focused on a single business function and provide clearer details on how scrum/sprint would operate for that function. Keep up the good work!"
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. The response provides some insight into the use of scrum/sprint and kanban methodologies, but it lacks specific details on how they could operate for the chosen business functions."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit.

Comment: Good attempt, but the explanation of why kanban is a poor fit for the chosen function could be clearer and more specific. Keep up the good work!"
10/10 - Great job identifying the business function that could benefit from kanban and providing a clear explanation of how it could operate in that context. Keep up the good work!
"Rating: 8/10

Comment: Good effort in discussing the implementation of kanban, but some more details on the possible columns and specific benefits would be helpful."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit.

Comment: Good attempt at addressing the prompts, but the discussion on why scrum/sprint is a poor fit for a specific function could be clearer and more complete."
"4 pts - Not really clear that this bias is relevant to the situation. The overconfidence bias is mentioned, but it's not clearly connected to Jackson's decision-making about moving to agile."
"10/10

Great job defining the Overconfidence Bias and providing a practical suggestion to address it using the Delphi Method. Keep up the good work!"
12 pts - Complete and clear description of possible problem. Great job in providing a detailed explanation of the potential issue and offering suggestions to address it. Keep up the good work!
