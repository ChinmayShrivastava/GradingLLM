"6/10 - You identified the manufacturing stage as a business function that could benefit from scrum/sprint methodologies, but it is not the most likely candidate. Consider focusing on the product design and development stages for a better fit with scrum/sprint."
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. 

Your response provides a general idea of how scrum/sprint and kanban could be implemented in Mighty Jaxx's business functions, but it lacks specific details on how these methodologies would operate for the chosen functions."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit.

Comment: Good attempt at explaining the poor fit of kanban for the manufacturing stage, but could be more specific about why it's not suitable for this function."
10/10 - Great job identifying the design and distribution stages as potential areas for implementing kanban methodologies. Your explanation of the benefits and flexibility of kanban in these areas is well thought out. Keep up the good work!
12 pts - Very complete and clear description of how kanban could operate. Great job explaining the benefits and implementation of kanban in the design and distribution stages. Keep up the good work!
"5 pts - Overly general description of poor fit; not specific to this function. 

Your response provides some insight into the benefits of Scrum and Kanban for different functions, but it lacks a clear and specific explanation of why scrum/sprint is a poor fit for the chosen function."
"4 pts - Not really clear that this bias is relevant to the situation. The regency bias is mentioned, but it's not clearly connected to the decision-making process about moving toward agile."
"6 pts - Noticeable errors or misunderstanding in the definition.

Comment: Your response does not clearly define the selected cognitive bias (regency bias). Please provide a clear definition and explanation of the bias in your response."
"10 pts - Reasonable description, but missing some detail. Good effort in explaining the implementation of Scrum and Kanban, but could use more clarity and detail in certain areas. Keep up the good work!"
"8 pts - Reasonable description, but missing some detail. Good effort in addressing the prompts, but some areas could use more elaboration and clarity. Keep up the good work!"
