10/10 - Great job identifying the production function as a suitable candidate for scrum/sprint methodologies and providing a clear explanation of why it would be beneficial. Keep up the good work!
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. Your response has some good points, but it lacks specific details on how scrum/sprint could operate for the chosen function."

Your response provided some information on scrum/sprint, but the prompt asked for a description of how kanban could operate for a specific business function. Please focus on kanban and provide a clear explanation with possible columns for the kanban board."
