"4 pts - Not really clear that this bias is relevant to the situation

Comment: You mentioned the retrievability bias, but it's not very clear how it directly relates to Jackson's decision-making about moving toward agile. Try to provide a more specific example of how this bias could impact his decision and suggest a step to avoid it."
"6/10 - You mentioned the retrievability bias, but your definition was not very clear. It's important to provide a concise and accurate definition of the bias. Keep practicing and refining your explanations."
"10 pts - Reasonable description, but missing some detail. 

Your response provides a good understanding of the benefits of using scrum methodologies for the 2D renderings function and the importance of addressing cognitive biases. However, it would be helpful to include more details on how the Kanban process can be applied to other functions in the company. Keep up the good work!"
