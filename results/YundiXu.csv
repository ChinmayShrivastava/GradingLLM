"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint. Good effort in explaining the implementation, but the chosen function may not be the best fit for scrum/sprint methodologies."
"10 pts - Some vagueness in description, but largely OK. Good effort in identifying the business functions and explaining the methodologies, but could be more specific in the scrum/sprint process."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit.

Comment: Good attempt at explaining why kanban is not the best fit, but it could be more specific to the function. Keep up the good work!"

Great job identifying the anchoring bias and explaining its potential impact on decision-making in this context. Keep up the good work!"
"6 pts - Noticeable errors or misunderstanding in the definition. Your description of anchoring bias is not entirely accurate, and it would be helpful to provide a clearer definition and explanation of how it could impact Jackson's decision-making process."
12 pts - Complete and clear description of possible problem. Great job addressing the potential issues and providing a thoughtful response to the prompt. Keep up the good work!
"8 pts - Reasonable description, but missing some detail. Good effort in explaining the benefits of Kanban, but more detail on the implementation process would be helpful. Keep up the good work!"
