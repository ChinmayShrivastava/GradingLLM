6 pts - Identified business function is unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint. The response discusses the benefits of scrum/sprint and kanban methodologies but does not clearly identify a specific business function that would benefit the most from implementing scrum/sprint.
6 pts - Overly general description of scrum/sprint without addressing the proposed business function. Please focus more on the specific business function and how scrum/sprint could operate for it.
"5 pts - Overly general description of poor fit; not specific to this function.

Comment: Your discussion on why kanban is a poor fit is quite general. Please provide more specific examples related to the function you chose."
"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from kanban. Good effort in explaining the benefits of Kanban for marketing and distribution, but consider focusing on a single business function for a clearer response."
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. Your response provides a general understanding of how Kanban could benefit the marketing and distribution departments, but it lacks specific details on how it would operate for those functions."
"7 pts - Some vagueness or incompleteness in discussion of fit.

Comment: Good attempt at discussing the poor fit of scrum/sprint for certain functions, but it would be helpful to provide more specific examples and clearer explanations. Keep up the good work!"

"8/10 - Good job on describing the Scrum process and its benefits for the 2D and 3D rendering departments. However, some details on how to implement the process could have been clearer. Keep up the good work!"
