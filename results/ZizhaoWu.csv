"8 pts - Identified business function is somewhat unlikely to benefit from scrum/sprint. 

Comment: Good effort in discussing the potential benefits of scrum/sprint for product development, but consider focusing on a more suitable business function for scrum/sprint methodologies. Keep up the good work!"
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content. 

Comment: Good attempt at explaining scrum/sprint for product development, but more details on how it operates would be helpful. Keep up the good work!"
5 pts - Your description of the poor fit of kanban is overly general and not specific to the function. Please provide more details on why kanban is not suitable for the chosen function.
10 pts - Great job identifying the manufacturing process as a business function that could benefit from kanban methodologies. Your explanation of how kanban could operate for this function is clear and well-organized. Keep up the good work!
"8 pts - Missing significant explanatory content

Your response touched on the benefits of kanban for the manufacturing process, but it lacked a clear and specific explanation of how kanban could operate for this function. Consider providing a more detailed description of the possible columns in the kanban board and how they would be used in the context of Mighty Jaxx's business function."
